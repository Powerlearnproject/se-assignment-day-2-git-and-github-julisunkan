## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that helps track changes made to files over time. 

Fundamental concepts of version control include:
1. Tracking and managing changes to software code.
2. Recording changes to files over time.
3. Accessing historical versions of a project.
4. Recovering specific versions.
5. Undoing specific edits without losing work.

GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code due to its several features like: 
1. Git Integration which allows branching, merging and commit history. This allows developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions as needed.
2. Collaboration: Developers can work together on projects. Features like pull requests, issues, and code reviews facilitate teamwork and ensure code quality.
3. Project management: GitHub provides tools for project management, including issue tracking, milestones, and wikis, which help teams organize and prioritize their work.
4. Integration with other tools like CI/CD pipelines
5. Cloud-based hosting
6. Security and privacy

Version control helps maintain project integrity by: Tracking Changes, Preventing Overwrites, Reverting to Previous Version, Collaboration, Code Reviews and Backup
